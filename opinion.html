      <h3>Students React to NELFUND Loan Disbursement Delay</h3>
      <p>
        The delay in disbursement of the NELFUND student loan has sparked mixed reactions among students of FUNAAB...
        <span class="more-text">
          Many students expressed frustration, stating that the delay has made it difficult to pay their school fees 
          and complete registration.  
          A 200-level student of Information Technology lamented, “We were promised quick disbursement once approved, 
          but weeks have passed with no update.”  

          On the other hand, some students urged patience, saying that the federal process takes time 
          and the loan will eventually be credited.  
          Financial experts on campus advised beneficiaries to use the funds strictly for academic expenses 
          and avoid unnecessary spending once received.  

          The university management has assured students that it is in touch with NELFUND officials 
          to ensure timely communication and transparency.

      <h3>Life in the Hostels: Between Comfort and Chaos</h3>
      <p>
        Hostel life at FUNAAB is an experience every student remembers — for better or worse...
        <span class="more-text">
          For some, it’s a place of lasting friendship, night study sessions, and shared laughter.  
          For others, it’s a daily struggle with water shortages, noisy roommates, and tight spaces.  

          Students from different halls shared their perspectives.  
          “I love the social life, but sometimes privacy is impossible,” said Kemi, a resident of Iyalode Tinubu Hostel(IYAT).  
          Others called for better maintenance and stricter hall rules.  

          The university management recently announced plans to improve hostel facilities 
          and renovate some aging buildings.  
          Still, for most students, hostel life remains a mix of memories, lessons, and survival.

      <h3>Exam Stress and the Need for Mental Health Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        As the semester draws to a close, many students find themselves battling anxiety, sleeplessness, 
        and exam pressure...
        <span class="more-text">
          Mental health discussions on campus have become more common, but many students still struggle 
          in silence.  
          A Psychology lecturer noted that “academic pressure should never come at the cost of one’s well-being.”  

          The Students’ Union Welfare Committee has launched a peer-support initiative called *Talk2Me*, 
          where trained volunteers offer listening ears to stressed students.  
          The university clinic also encourages students to seek help early rather than overworking themselves.  

          “Rest is part of studying,” said a 300-level Biochemistry student.  
          It’s a reminder that success means more when achieved with a healthy mind.

      <h3>Student Leadership: Service or Self-Interest?</h3>
      <p>
        With upcoming Students’ Union elections around the corner, debates have emerged about 
        what true leadership should mean on campus...
        <span class="more-text">
          Some students believe leadership should be about service, representation, and genuine 
          concern for others.  
          Others argue that many aspirants only seek fame, popularity, and influence.  

          “Leadership on campus is a reflection of leadership in society,” said a Political Science student.  
          “We must choose people with integrity, not just loud voices.”  

          The SU President responded, saying that leadership comes with sacrifice, 
          and that anyone vying for office must be prepared to serve selflessly.  
          Students are encouraged to vote responsibly during the election week.
