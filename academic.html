        <h3>FUNAAB Management Clarifies NELFUND Loan and School Fees Payment Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          The Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) management has released an important update concerning school fees payment and the recently introduced NELFUND student loan scheme...
          <span class="more-text">
            According to a circular issued by the Registrar’s Office, all students who applied for the National Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) are advised to verify their loan approval status before the start of the new semester.  
            The university confirmed that students whose applications are successful will have their tuition fees automatically settled through the official school portal once funds are disbursed.  

            However, students who are yet to complete their NELFUND application are urged to do so immediately to avoid delays in registration.  
            The management also stated that students who prefer to pay manually can still generate their payment invoice on the FUNAAB portal and make payment via approved bank channels.  

            In a statement, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Prof. Kehinde Olasupo, emphasized that “the NELFUND initiative is designed to ease financial stress for students and promote equal access to quality education.”  
            He also warned against fake agents claiming to assist with loan applications, reminding students to follow only the official NELFUND website and FUNAAB communication channels.  

            Students are encouraged to keep their payment receipts and transaction details safe for future reference.  
            The Students’ Union President, Comr. Adeniyi Boluwatife, applauded the government for the initiative but appealed for faster processing time for applicants still awaiting approval.
