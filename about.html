    <h2>About FUNAABSU Gist Gig</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>FUNAABSU Gist Gig</strong> is the official online campus news platform of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB).
      Built by creative minds within the Students’ Union, it tells the stories that shape student life — from lectures and campus events
      to student innovations and achievements.  
      We are more than a news site; we are the voice of every FUNAABite.

  <section class="about-history">
    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
    <p>
      The idea for FUNAABSU Gist Gig started in 2024 when a group of students realized how scattered and inconsistent campus information had become.
      Students were missing important updates, event details, and even official communications because there was no single, reliable source of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      With support from the Students’ Union executives, the project evolved into a web-based news hub that blends professionalism and student energy.
      The first articles published covered topics like student entrepreneurship, faculty events, and sports highlights — and the reception was overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      By early 2025, Gist Gig had become FUNAAB’s most visited student-run platform, earning mentions from the school’s ICT Directorate and recognition
      from student organizations like NIFAAS, NUESA, and NASS.  
      Every story published since then has strengthened our mission: to inform, engage, and inspire.*

    <h3>Our Impact on Campus</h3>
    <p>
      Since its inception, Gist Gig has improved information sharing at FUNAAB. Lecturers now send notices through the platform,
      while departments use it to announce events and academic opportunities. Students, on the other hand, rely on it for NELFUND updates,
      fresher guides, and sports results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond news, the platform also trains volunteer reporters — equipping students with skills in writing, digital design, and media ethics.
      Many of our early contributors have since gone on to write for national youth magazines and tech blogs.
